    "This course covers the Process and Platform you can use for Data Science projects, using SQL Server 2016 and higher. Using Machine Learning Services inside a database engine allows you to keep the data integrity you have built into your RDBMS, provides a high level of security, the ability to work on premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid fashion, and eliminates data travel outside your database environment. It also allows your data professionals to work in the area they know well, and still allow Data Scientists to work with R or Python to perform predictive, clustering, and categorical models with easy deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course you'll set up your SQL Server environment and use a client tool to work with a database to create a predictive solution that you will deploy with a Stored Procedure. You'll follow a defined process to understand the business requirements, examine the data from a customer database, create two experiments to find the best model, and deploy the completed model in a Stored Procedure that is called from a client application."

Machine Learning technologies consume large amounts of data in the form of *Features* (columns of data that are predictive or classifying in nature) and *Labels* (the data you want to predict or classify). For instance, knowing where someone grew up or traveled to can give you insight into the types of food they might like to eat.\n",

It then selects the best path to work with data it has *not* seen. You can then send new data (Features) and the Model will return it's guess for the Label, usually along with how confident it is in the guess.\n",
