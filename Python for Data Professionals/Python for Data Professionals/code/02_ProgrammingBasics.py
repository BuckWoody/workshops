# 2.1 Getting Help
help()
help(str)

# <TODO> - Write code to find help on help

# 2.2 Code Syntax and Structure

# <TODO> - Python uses spaces to indicate code blocks. Fix the code below:
x=10
y=5
if x > y:
print(str(x) + " is greater than " + str(y))

# <TODO> - Arguments on first line are forbidden when not using vertical alignment. Fix this code:
foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
    var_three, var_four)

# <TODO> operators sit far away from their operands. Fix this code:
income = (gross_wages +
          taxable_interest +
          (dividends - qualified_dividends) -
          ira_deduction -
          student_loan_interest)

# <TODO> - The import statement should use separate lines for each effort. You can fix the code below 
# using separate lines or by using the "from" statement:
import sys, os

# <TODO> - The following code has extra spaces in the wrong places. Fix this code:
i=i+1
submitted +=1
x = x * 2 - 1
hypot2 = x * x + y * y
c = (a + b) * (a - b)

# 2.3 Variables 

# <TODO> - Add a line below x=3 that changes the variable x from int to a string
x=3
type(x)

# <TODO> - Write code that prints the string "This class is awesome" using variables:
x="is awesome"
y="This Class"

# 2.4 Operations and Functions

# <TODO> - Use some basic operators to write the following code:
# Assign two variables
# Add them
# Subtract 20 from each, add those values together, save that to a new variable
# Create a new string variable with the text "The result of my operations are: "
# Print out a single string on the screen with the result of the variables 
#   showing that result.
