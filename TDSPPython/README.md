# The Team Data Science Process Workshop

## Microsoft Cloud and AI

The Team Data Science Process (TDSP) is an agile, iterative data science methodology to deliver predictive analytics solutions and intelligent applications efficiently. TDSP helps improve team collaboration and learning. It contains a distillation of the best practices and structures from Microsoft and others in the industry that facilitate the successful implementation of data science initiatives. The goal is to help companies fully realize the benefits of their analytics program.

TDSP comprises of the following key components:

 - A data science lifecycle definition
 - A standardized project structure
    Infrastructure and resources for data science projects
    Tools and utilities for project execution

*This workshop guides you through a series of exercises you can use to learn to implement the TDSP in your Data Science project, using only Python in a Notebook. You can change the **Setup** and **Lab** cells in this Notebook to use another language, another platform, and with more or fewer prompts based on your audience's needs.*
