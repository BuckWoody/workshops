# Python for Data Professionals

## 01 Overview and Setup

In this course you'll cover the basics of the Python language and environment from a Data Professional's perspective. While you will learn Python, you'll quickly cover topics that have a lot more depth available. In each section you'll get more references to go deeper, which you should follow up on. Also watch for links within the text - click on each one to explore that topic.

Make sure you check out the **00 Pre-Requisites** page before you start. You'll need all of the items loaded there before you can proceed with the course.

You'll cover these topics in the course:

There are two main versions of Python - 2 and 3. So many programs were written for version 2 that it is still around, and version 3 was such an upgrade that programs for 2 don't always run in 3 and visa-versa. For this course we'll do everything in version 3 - it's becoming the accepted standard for data professionals.

You have a few ways of working with Python:

- The Interactive Interpreter (Type `python` and the version number if it is in your path)
- Writing code and running it in some graphical environment (Such as VSCode, Visual Studio, Spyder, PyCharm, IDLE, etc.)
- Calling a `.py` script file from the `python` command 

When you're in command-mode, you'll see that the code looks more like a scripting language, meaning that some parenthesis around functions might not be there. Programming-mode looks like a standard programming language environment - you'll normally use that within an Integrated Programming Environment (IDE).
