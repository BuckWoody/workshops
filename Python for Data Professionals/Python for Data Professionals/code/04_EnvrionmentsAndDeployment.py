# <TODO> - 4.1 Show the main environment variables in the current Python environment. Which directory has the libraries?

# <TODO> - What else can you find in the sysconfig library? How would you find that out?

# <TODO> - Using conda commands, what libraries are currently loaded? 
# How would you install a new one? 
# What environment are you using now?

# <TODO> - 4.2 Create a program that has three text variables. Combine these three into another varaible. 
# Load the pickle library and save the results of the first program as a pkl file.
# Close the first program, and create another one that opens and reads the pkl file.
# Combine the final variable from the last program with a next text variable from this program.
