Welcome to this Microsoft Solutions course on *Microsoft SQL Server Big Data Clusters Architecture*. In this course, you'll learn how SQL Server big data clusters implements machine learning, and how to select and plan for the proper architecture to enable machine learning to train your models using Python, R, Java or SparkML to operationalize these models, and how to deploy your intelligent apps side-by-side with their data.

The focus of this course is to understand how to deploy an on-premise, hybrid or local environments of a big data cluster, and understanding the components of the big data solution architecture.

You'll start by understanding the concepts of big data analytics and data virtualization in SQL Server, and you'll get an overview of the technologies (such as containers, Kubernetes, Spark and HDFS, machine learning, and when to use which language) that you will use throughout the course. You'll also learn how to create external tables over other data sources to unify your data, and how to use Spark to run big queries over your data in HDFS or do data prep. You'll learn to extrapolate what you have learned to create other solutions on your own.

This README.MD file explains how the course is laid out, what you will learn, and the technologies you will use in this solution.
