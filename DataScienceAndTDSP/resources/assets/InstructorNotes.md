## Cover goals

  *  Go over the goals for the class
  *  [Show learning path](https://github.com/Azure/learnAnalytics-CreatingSolutionswiththeTeamDataScienceProcess-/blob/master/Instructions/Learning%20Path%20-%20Creating%20Solutions%20with%20the%20Team%20Data%20Science%20Process.md)

## Introduction and setup

  *  Verify the pre-reqs. If students have not done the pre-reqs, you can have them start the Data Science Virtual Machine build and have them follow along with a seat-mate until the build completes, and then try and catch up. 

## Introduction to the TDSP

  *  Walk each phase of the TDSP. [Open the documentation and display.](http://aka.ms/tdsp)
  *  [Open this graphic and walk it down.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/media/overview/tdsp-tasks-by-roles.png)

## 1. Business Understanding

  *  This course deals with the Contoso example
  *  It's best to do the first lab (at least the first part) with the class to show the differences in icons and spelling. (approximate time 10 mins)
  *  The second lab that follows is optional, but it's a good idea to at least explain it. (approximate time 10 mins)

## 2. Data Acquisition and Understanding

  *  Explain that the primary part of this lab is simply opening the template. (approximate time 15 mins)
  *  Show how to use the pull-down for the runs. Note that the runs can take a while, but the project is actually already complete
  *  Tell the class to leave the project open - we'll be using it throughout

## 3. Modeling

  *  Show how to use the pull-down for the runs. Note that the runs can take a while, but the project is actually already complete

## 4.  Deployment

  *  Here we'll drop to the az ml commands. Depending on time, you can explain this way of working, or just have them do it. 
  *  You may want to explain the Docker, Local, and Spark environments, if you have time. 

## 5.  Customer Acceptance

  *  Since you're focusing on TDSP here, you may want to re-iterate that you're not focusing on the Data Science or the code at the moment, just the process and especially this document. 

## Workshop Completion

  *  Have the student de-commission everything at this point, except for the DVSM and AMLS accounts if they are planning to continue.
