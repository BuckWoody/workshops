    "The Team Data Science Process (TDSP) is an agile, iterative data science methodology to deliver predictive analytics solutions and intelligent applications efficiently. TDSP helps improve team collaboration and learning. It contains a distillation of the best practices and structures from Microsoft and others in the industry that facilitate the successful implementation of data science initiatives. The goal is to help companies fully realize the benefits of their analytics program.\n",
    "\n",
    "TDSP comprises of the following key components:\n",
    "\n",
    " - A data science lifecycle definition\n",
    " - A standardized project structure\n",
    "    Infrastructure and resources for data science projects\n",
    "    Tools and utilities for project execution\n",
