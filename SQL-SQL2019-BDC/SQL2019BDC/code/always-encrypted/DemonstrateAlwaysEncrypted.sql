-- We need a column master key. This key is used to encrypt the column encryption keys.
-- The column master key isn't really stored in the database. It's created and stored on the 
-- client system. SQL Server only holds a link to it so that SQL Server can tell the 
-- client application where to locate the master key. The client system will encrypt a column
-- encryption key with this master key.

-- The wizard will create a certificate, install it in the certificate store, then
-- register it with SQL Server via CREATE COLUMN MASTER KEY

-- 1a. In Object Explorer, expand the security node in WideWorldImporters, then expand
--     the Always Encrypted Keys node and note the contents.
-- 1b. Right-click the Column Master Keys node and click New Column Master Key.
-- 1c. For the name, enter WWI_ColumnMasterKey.
-- 1d. Note the available entries in the Key store dropdown list. Choose Windows Certificate Store - Current User. 
--     This will only be a temporary location for the certificate.
-- 1e. Click Generate Certificate to create the new certificate. Note that an Always Encrypted certificate
--     has been created. Ensure that it is selected, then click OK.

-- We have used the MSSQL_CERTIFICATE_STORE which uses the Windows store 
-- but we can use any store that implements the SqlColumnEncryptionKeyStoreProvider 
-- class. (And is registered by calling the SqlConnection.RegisterColumnEncryptionKeyStoreProviders() 
-- method). This requires .NET framework 4.6.1 or later on the client.

-- The certificate could also have been created via the makecert utility and just loaded on the client.

-- We can see the newly created master key. Note the key_path. This path is relative to the client.

-- The next key that we need is used for performing column encryption. It's held encrypted on the
-- database server and is decrypted (and cached) on the client application before use.
-- On the client system, it is protected by the column master key.

-- 2a. In Object Explorer, right-click the Column Encryption Keys node and click New Column Encryption Key.
-- 2b. In the Name textbox, enter WWI_ColumnEncryptionKey and from the Column master key dropdown list, 
--     select WWI_ColumnMasterKey to be used to encrypt this new key. Then click OK.

-- We can see the newly created encryption key.
