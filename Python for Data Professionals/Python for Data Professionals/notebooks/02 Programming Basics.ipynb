After you work through these copy-and-paste examples, you'll create your own code in the Activities that follow each section."

    "    Explicit is better than implicit.\n",

    "    Readability counts.\n",
    "    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\n",
    "    Although practicality beats purity.\n",
    "    Errors should never pass silently.\n",
    "    Unless explicitly silenced.\n",
    "    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\n",
    "    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\n",
    "    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\n",
    "    Now is better than never.\n",
    "    Although never is often better than right now.\n",
    "    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\n",

    "In general, use standard coding practices - don't use keywords for variables, be consistent in your naming (camel-case, lower-case, etc.), comment your code clearly, and understand the general syntax of your language, and follow the principles above. But the most important tip is to at least read the PEP 8 and decide for yourself how well that fits into your Zen.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one hard-and-fast rule for Python that you *do* need to be aware of: indentation. You **must** indent your code for classes, functions (or methods), loops, conditions, and lists.  You can use a tab or four spaces (spaces are the accepted way to do it) but in any case, you have to be consistent. If you use tabs, you always use tabs. If you use spaces, you have to use that throughout. It's best if you set your IDE to handle that for you, whichever way you go.\n",

    "Python code files have an extension of `.py`.  \n",

    "Comments in Python start with the hash-tag: `#`. There are no block comments (and this makes us all sad) so each line you want to comment must have a tag in front of that line. Keep the lines short (80 characters or so) so that they don't fall off a single-line display like at the command line."
