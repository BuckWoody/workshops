    "In this course you'll cover the basics of the Python language and environment from a Data Professional's perspective. While you will learn Python, you'll quickly cover topics that have a lot more depth available. In each section you'll get more references to go deeper, which you should follow up on. Also watch for links within the text - click on each one to explore that topic.\n",

    "There are two main versions of Python - 2 and 3. So many programs were written for version 2 that it is still around, and version 3 was such an upgrade that programs for 2 don't always run in 3 and visa-versa. For this course we'll do everything in version 3 - it's becoming the accepted standard for data professionals.\n",

    "- The Interactive Interpreter (Type `python` and the version number if it is in your path)\n",
    "- Writing code and running it in some graphical environment (Such as VSCode, Visual Studio, Spyder, PyCharm, IDLE, etc.)\n",
    "- Calling a `.py` script file from the `python` command \n",
    "\n",
    "When you're in command-mode, you'll see that the code looks more like a scripting language, meaning that some parenthesis around functions might not be there. Programming-mode looks like a standard programming language environment - you'll normally use that within an Integrated Programming Environment (IDE)."
