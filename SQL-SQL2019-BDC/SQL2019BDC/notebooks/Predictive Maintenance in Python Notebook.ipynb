    "## Problem Description\n",
    "A major problem faced by businesses in asset-heavy industries such as manufacturing is the significant costs that are associated with delays in the production process due to mechanical problems. Most of these businesses are interested in predicting these problems in advance so that they can proactively prevent the problems before they occur which will reduce the costly impact caused by downtime. Please refer to the [playbook for predictive maintenance](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cortana-analytics-playbook-predictive-maintenance/ ) for a detailed explanation of common use cases in predictive maintenance and modelling approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we follow the ideas from the playbook referenced above and aim to provide the steps of implementing a predictive model for a scenario which is based on a synthesis of multiple real-world business problems. This example brings together common data elements observed among many predictive maintenance use cases and the data itself is created by data simulation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The business problem for this example is about predicting problems caused by component failures such that the question \"What is the probability that a machine will fail in the near future due to a failure of a certain component?\" can be answered.  The problem is formatted as a multi-class classification problem and a machine learning algorithm is used to create the predictive model that learns from historical data collected from machines. In the following sections, we go through the steps of implementing such a model which are feature engineering, label construction, training  and evaluation. First, we start by explaining the data sources in the next section."

    "\n",
    "When working with time-stamped data as in this example, record partitioning into training, validation, and test sets should be performed carefully to prevent overestimating the performance of the models. In predictive maintenance, the features are usually generated using lagging aggregates: records in the same time window will likely have identical labels and similar feature values. These correlations can give a model an \"unfair advantage\" when predicting on a test set record that shares its time window with a training set record. We therefore partition records into training, validation, and test sets in large chunks, to minimize the number of time intervals shared between them.\n",

    "Predictive models have no advance knowledge of future chronological trends: in practice, such trends are likely to exist and to adversely impact the model's performance. To obtain an accurate assessment of a predictive model's performance, we recommend training on older records and validating/testing using newer records.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both of these reasons, a time-dependent record splitting strategy is an excellent choice for predictive maintenace models. The split is effected by choosing a point in time based on the desired size of the training and test sets: all records before the timepoint are used for training the model, and all remaining records are used for testing. (If desired, the timeline could be further divided to create validation sets for parameter selection.) To prevent any records in the training set from sharing time windows with the records in the test set, we remove any records at the boundary -- in this case, by ignoring 24 hours' worth of data prior to the timepoint."

This causes low recall rates although accuracy can be high and becomes a larger problem when the cost of false alarms to the business is very high.

Below, we compare the recall rates for each failure type for the three models. The recall rates for all components as well as no failure are all above 90% meaning the model was able to capture above 90% of the failures correctly."

Typical steps of predictive maintenance such as feature engineering, labelling, training and evaluation are explained using the example data sets. Predictive models are built both using Python packages and Azure Machine Learning Studio."
