Ensure that the connection string is set appropriately. It is save when the program is edited. If you ever need to set it back to the default value, open the program, clear the string, and exit the program. When you restart the program, the connection string will have been returned to the default value.

The program uses the selected number of threads to concurrently call the `Website.InsertCustomerOrder` stored procedure.

When inserts are occurring, click the button to stop but allow time for the system to respond and stop. It may take a few seconds to respond, particularly if a larger number of threads is being used.
